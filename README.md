it's more about CoT imaging, like getting to know where this model starts off (visually) and its progress towards the answer. The layers and tensors are closed-source, so this is pure token based.

For some actual "neuro"imaging, look at my mechanistic interpretability repository. it covers the deepseek r1 model, following the layers for the same questions.
